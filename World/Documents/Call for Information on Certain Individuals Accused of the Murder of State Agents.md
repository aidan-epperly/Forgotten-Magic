### Calling All Loyal Servants of the Matudaira Clan
---
A grave crime has been committed on our lands. We call to all the loyal servants of the Matudaira clan, and to all who claim our friendship for aid in discovering the cause of this heinous act. This past week, three noble warriors fell at the hands of five dishonorable bandits lodging at the Yuni travel outpost.

These five dishonorable bandits are believed to be spies sent by the Kiku family to undermine our trade routes and stir up trouble in the region. They are also suspected of using occult techniques to attempt to assassinate the Daimyo by means of exploding fish.

There is a ¥20,000 reward for information leading to the capture or killing of any of these bandits and an addition ¥40,000 for each of them, dead or alive.
