Once upon a time, there was a boy. He lived with his mother on the edge of a large forest. One day, his mother sent him to go get some water from the river that ran through the forest. The boy walked through the dense trees and foliage. When he came to the river, he saw a snake drinking from the stream. The boy was frightened by the snake so he turned to run. Just then, the snake turned to the boy.

"Wait," said the snake, "don't leave. I'm so alone."

"What?" said the boy to the snake, "how could you ever be alone. Everywhere I go in the forest I see snakes like you slithering around."

"I'm a special snake! All the snakes in the forest are jealous of my beautiful golden scales."

The snake did have beautiful lustrous scales that shined golden in the sun.

"Okay," said the boy, "I can stay with you." So the boy say with the snake by the river.

Every day the boy would go to the river to fetch some water and he would see the snake drinking from river. Every time the boy saw the snake, it would get bigger and bigger until it was thicker than a tree and longer than the height of four men.

"You've gotten much larger!" said the boy one day.

"You're right," said the snake to the boy. "The river running through this forest has mystical powers. It gave me my beautiful golden scales and made me big and strong."

"Then why don't the other animals drink from it? If they did wouldn't they become strong like you?"

"They're too scared." said the snake, "they're afraid of my golden scales and tremendous size. They're scared of change."

"Wait!" the boy said realizing. "I've been drinking this water every day and so has my mom! What is going to happen to us?"
