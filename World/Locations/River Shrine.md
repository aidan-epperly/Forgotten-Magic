The River Shrine is a sacred site hidden deep within the Forest of Theron. It is home to two unnamed [[River Spirits]] who present as red and black carp.
### The River
---
Ever since the return of the River Shrine to the area, a great river has flowed through Theron. A number of small sandbars and islands now reside within the River. The flora on these islands is otherworldly and no animals dare to approach the water.

#### Drinking from the River
---
Various player characters have consumed the water from the River. Primrose drank from the water and healed her arm after the fight with Arthur and the Golden Snake. Catheron drank from the water and was told that the river spirits had already granted their power to another.

### Domain
---
The River Shrine seems to exert dominance over the whole forest of Theron. Aiko noted at the former location of the Tower that the only spiritual presence was the river spirits.
