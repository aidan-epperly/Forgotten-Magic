The Holy Temple of Theron is a beautiful Shinto-Buddhist temple nestled in the forest of Theron. The Temple's main source of income is the production of traditional ink blocks. The site of the Temple was previously occupied by a strange tower that vanished some time after the death of Arthur and the Snake.

### History
---
The site of the Temple was previously occupied by a Shinto shrine during the First Age of Spirits. After the Spirit Purge, a group of local Buddhists erected what would later become the Temple. In the most of its existence, the temple was relatively simple and existed entirely off of donations. With the import of bees from outside The Island, the Temple really hit its stride producing candles and then traditional candle soot ink blocks.

### The Tower Incursion
---
There are no existing records of this, but the Players are aware of the existence of the Tower. For roughly thirty years, the site of the Temple has been host to a large unearthly Tower. The architectural style and construction of the Tower was completely anathema to the cultural practices around.
