The Twin River Spirits of Theron are two red and black carp swimming in endless circles at the [[River Shrine]]. When they were last seen, they were roughly fifty feet long and their size has increased every time they've been seen. They have lent their power to Primrose in the form the Black Sunset Sword and a beautiful sleeve tattoo on Primrose's right arm.
