The Great Mountain Spirit is the singular spirit personifying the many mountains of The Island.

### Great Oak

The only known shrine of the Mountain Spirit is the Great Oak nestled in the mountain range dividing the Forest of Theron and the coast.

#### Acorn Defense System

The Great Oak apparently has an "acorn defense system" which allowed the Mountain Spirit to survive the Spirit Purge. The Great Mountain Spirit claims that anyone other than his followers will be killed instantly by this defense system, but a mechanism of death has not been provided.

#### Spirit Spore Mushrooms

There are a number of bioluminescent "fungi" growing on the surface of the Great Oak. These apparent mushrooms are actually small hatcheries creating and raising trillions of baby spirits.

### Contracts

The Great Mountain Spirit has only one known contract.
