An *attack* is any action intended to directly harm another. So, for instance, pushing someone off a cliff would be an attack, but pushing someone away from you would not. In the FEUDAL system, attacks should be the last option in any scenario, so the system for attacking is the most complicated and devastating.

An attack breaks in to the following steps:
1. Connecting - the act of actually hitting the person in question with your attack
2. Damaging - determining the damage that is done by the attack
3. Resistance - how well the person being attacked resists being damaged

#### Connecting
---
Determining if the attack hits is a straight contest between a hit roll and a defend roll. So, for instance, if the Attacker was using 1d12 Fire to attack and the Defender was using 1d10 Earth to defend a (A: 9, D:4) would hit with a +5 and (A:5, D:6) would miss.

#### Damaging and Resistance
---
Damage is another roll-off between the Attacker and Defender, but this time the Attacker has an advantage. The Defender always rolls physical resistance, but the Attacker rolls based on the following table.

| Weapon Quality | Damage Die |
| ---- | ---- |
| Untrained Unarmed | 1d4 |
| Trained Unarmed | 1d6 |
| Simple Weapons | 1d8 |
| Proper Weapons | 1d10 |
| Epic Weapons | 1d12 / 1d10 + 1dR |
