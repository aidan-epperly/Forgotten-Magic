When a Character is harmed, such as from someone [[Making an Attack]], they take a certain amount of damage. A given person can only take a certain amount of damage before succumbing to their wounds. The following are some common damage tolerances.

| Type of Person | Damage |
| ---- | ---- |
| Commoner | 3 |
| Town Guard | 4 |
| Samurai | 5 |
| Daimyo | 6 |
| Shogun | 10 |
| PC | dR |

Note, these numbers are intentionally low. True combat should be short and lethal.

#### PC Wounds
---
Player Characters have a damage tolerance equal to the number of sides of their physical resistance die. If they receive more wounds than this, they have four options.

1. Die - the Character dies and the Player creates a new Character
2. Be Wounded - the Character lives but receives a grave and permanent wound. These wounds can be overcome, but likely only as the result of a long term quest or mission.
3. Be Traumatized - the Character lives but suffers a grave trauma. This trauma can likely be overcome, but likely only as the result of a long term quest or mission.
4. Accept Help From a Spirit - the Character reaches out and accepts help from an unknown Spirit. With this option and this option alone, the Player gives full narrative control to the Host.

#### NPC Wounds

When non-Player Characters suffer more damage than their tolerance, they are presumed dead. If someone in their party survives and retrieves them, they may live, but if all the NPCs on their side fall, they will all likely die.
