Unlike other systems, the FEUDAL system has no constant difficulty rolls. Everything is a roll-off between the Host and the Player. Rolls should only be done to accomplish tasks that would not otherwise be trivial for the Character to do, or in the case where two sentient beings are having a battle of skill. Given the prevalence of spirits, the latter is more common than one might expect.
### Common Difficulties
---
The following is a general guide for the difficulty of various tasks in the FEUDAL system.

| Task | Difficulty |
| ---- | ---- |
| Trivial | 1 |
| Simple | 1d2 |
| Common | 1d4 |
| Complex | 1d6 |
| Difficult | 1d8 |
| Challenging | 1d10 |
| Daunting | 1d12 |
| Heroic | 2d6 |
#### Compounding Difficulties
---
Making a lot of rolls at once can awesome, but it's important that rolling a large number of dice at once doesn't become overwhelming. Thus, we use the following method for dealing with large rolls. 
1. If the roll hinges on the success or failure of a single individual, the person with the highest or lowest roll should make it and no one else.
2. If the roll hinges on the success or failure of the average performance of the group then the max or min of all the rolls made should be taken.
3. If the roll hinges on the success or failure of the group performance then the sum of all the rolls should be taken.
#### Multiple Tasks
---
Often times, you might need to accomplish a number of tasks at the same time. If these tasks are fully unrelated, then each task should be solved separately. Sometimes the success of a greater objective depends on the success of a number of other tasks. These break into the following categories.
1. If the success of the whole depends on a number of sequential unrelated tasks, the Host and Players should settle on the number of individual successes needed to complete the whole. Then each roll should be handled separately using the rules above.
2. If the success of the whole depends on a number of related tasks, the rolls for each task should all be done together and the results summed.
3. If the success of the whole depends on a number of parallel tasks, the roll should be resolved as above. However, in this case the Players cannot use the same roll for multiple tasks. If they do chose to use the same roll more than once, every additional roll of that stat takes a -1.
#### Unknown
---
The Unknown is mysterious and *coughs* unknown. In many cases, the unknown can be added to a roll, but with potentially negative ramifications. Adding your Unknown to a roll means welcoming spirits into your life. The general rule is that if your Unknown is higher than your base roll, something unexpected happens. Otherwise, everything works out as planned.
