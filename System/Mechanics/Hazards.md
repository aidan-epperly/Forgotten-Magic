Sometimes, the Environment will cause harm to a Character. Most of this time this will involve some large object hitting the player at high speed, the Character ingesting something toxic, or the character suffering from exposer to the elements. Note, this section will not cover traps! Instead, traps should are covered in [[Making an Attack]]. This is because the skill of the trap maker should effect how good the trap is. Similarly, using the Environment as part of an attack is not covered here. Throwing someone off a cliff, for instance, does not count as environmental damage.
### Falling
---
Falling is the most common cause of environmental damage. It is often destructive and unavoidable. The general rule is that every ten feet of falling should yield 1d6 of damage to a maximum of 10d6. Falling one hundred feet will thus lead to almost certain death. If an object is falling on you, a multiplier is applied to the number of feet needed to gain 1d6.

| Rough Weight of Object | Distance Multiplier |
| ---- | ---- |
| Stone | 0.25 |
| Cinder Block | 0.5 |
| Table | 0.75 |
| Granite Slab or Larger | 1 |
| Spiked or Jagged | + 1d6 (up to 11d6) |
### Poison and Venom
---
Many toxic substances exist in nature from venomous snakes to poisonous berries and everything in between. 
#### Venom
---
Venom in particular posses an interesting problem for this system as venom can essentially only be delivered as part of [[Making an Attack]]. As such, whether venom counts as environmental damage should follow from narrative considerations. It is entirely reasonable for a Character to have a toxin applied to their blade that would instantly kill any NPC they cut if it makes narrative sense, though in this case the toxin would certainly not be environmental damage.
